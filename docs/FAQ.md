**Q. How to get started with Argo Events?**

**A**. Recommended way to get started with Argo Events is,

 1. Read the basic concepts about [EventBus](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/concepts/eventbus/), [Sensor](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/concepts/sensor/) and [Event Source](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/concepts/event_source/).
 2. Install the setup as outlined [here](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/installation/).
 3. Read the tutorials available [here](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/tutorials/01-introduction/). 

**Q. Can I deploy event-source and sensor in a namespace different that `argo-events`?**

**A**.   Yes. If you want to deploy the event-source in a different namespace that `argo-events`, then please update the
event-source definition with desired namespace and service account. Make sure to grant the service account the necessary roles.

**Q. How to debug Argo-Events.**

**A**.

1. Make sure you have installed everything as instructed [here](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/installation/).
1. Make sure you have `EventBus` resource created in the namespace.
1. The  event-bus, event-source and sensor pods must be running. If you see any issue with the pods, check the logs
   for sensor-controller, event-source-controller or event-bus-controller.
1. If event-source and sensor pods are running, but you are not receiving any events:
     * Make sure you have configured the event source correctly.
     * Check the logs of the event-source pod's containers.

Note: You can set environment variable `DEBUG_LOG:true` in any of the containers to output debug logs.

**Q. Event-source pod is receiving the events but nothing happens.**

**A**. 

1. Check the sensor resource is deployed and a pod is running for the resource.
If sensor pod is running, check for the logs that says `Started to subscribe events for triggers`.
If the sensor has subscribed to the event-bus but unable to create the trigger resource, raise an issue on GitHub. 

**Q. Helm chart installation does not work.**

**A.** The helm chart for argo events is maintained by the community and can be out of sync with latest release version. The official installation file is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/manifests/install.yaml).
If you notice the helm chart is outdated, we encourage you to contribute to the [argo-helm](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm).

**Q. Kustomization file doesn't have a `X` resource.**

**A.** The kustomization.yaml file is maintained by the community. If you notice that it is out of sync with the official installation file, please
raise a PR.

**Q. Can I use Minio event-source for AWS S3 notifications?**

**A.** No. Minio event-source is exclusive for the Minio server. If you want to trigger workloads on AWS S3 bucket notification,
   then set up the AWS SNS event-source.

**Q. If I have multiple event dependencies and triggers in a single sensor, can I execute a specific trigger upon a specific event?**  

**A.** Yes, this is precisely the functionality the sensor event resolution circuitry offers. Please take a look at the [Circuit and Switch](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/tutorials/06-circuit-and-switch/).

**Q. The latest image tag does not point to latest release tag?**

**A.** When it comes to image tags, the golden rule is do not trust the latest tag. Always use the pinned version of the images.
   We will try to keep the `latest` in sync with the latest release version.

**Q. Where can I find the event structure for a particular event-source?**

**A.** Please refer [this file](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/pkg/apis/eventsource/v1alpha1/types.go) to understand the structure of different types of events dispatched by event-source pod.
