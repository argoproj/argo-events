# Argo Events - The Event-driven Workflow Automation Framework

## What is Argo Events?

**Argo Events** is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes
which helps you trigger K8s objects, Argo Workflows, Serverless workloads, etc.
on events from a variety of sources like webhooks, S3, schedules, messaging queues,
gcp pubsub, sns, sqs, etc.
