# OpenWhisk Trigger

OpenWhisk is a framework to run serverless workloads. It ships with its own event sources but their numbers are limited
and it doesn't have support for circuits, parameterization, filtering, on-demand payload construction, etc that a sensor provides.

## Prerequisite

- OpenWhisk must be up and running.

## Setup

Coming Soon...
