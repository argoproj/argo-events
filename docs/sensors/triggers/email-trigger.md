# Email Trigger

The Email trigger is used to send a custom email to a desired set of email addresses using an SMTP server. The intended use is for notifications for a build pipeline, but can be used for any notification scenario.

## Prerequisite

1. Deploy the eventbus in the namespace.

2. Have an SMTP server setup.

3. Create a kubernetes secret with the SMTP password in your cluster.

        kubectl create secret generic smtp-secret --from-literal=password=$SMTP_PASSWORD

      **Note**: If your SMTP server doesnot require authentication this step can be skipped.

4. Create a webhook event-source.

        kubectl -n argo-events apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/examples/event-sources/webhook.yaml

5. Set up port-forwarding to expose the http server. We will
   use port-forwarding here.

        kubectl port-forward -n argo-events <event-source-pod-name> 12000:12000

## Email Trigger

Lets say we want to send an email to a dynamic recepient using a custom email body template.

The custom email body template we are going to use is the following:
```
Hi <name>,
  Hello There

Thanks,
Obi
``` 
where the name has to be substituted with the receiver name from the event.

1. Create a sensor with Email trigger.

        kubectl -n argo-events apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/examples/sensors/email-trigger.yaml

      **Note**: Please update ```email.port```, ```email.host``` and ```email.username``` to that of your SMTP server.
        If your SMTP server doesnot require authentication, the ```email.username``` and ```email.smtpPassword``` should be ommitted.

2. Send a http request to the event-source-pod to fire the Email trigger.

        curl -d '{"name":"Luke", "to":"your@email.com"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:12000/example

      **Note**: You can modify the value for key ```"to"``` to send the email to your address.

2. Alternatively you can skip providing the ```"to"``` in the payload to send an email to static email address provided in the trigger.

        curl -d '{"name":"Luke"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:12000/example

      **Note**: You have to remove the parameterization for ```email.to.0``` and add ```email.to``` like so:
        ```yaml
        email:
          ...
          to:
            - target1@email.com
            - target2@email.com
          ...
        ```

## Parameterization

We can parameterize the to, from, subject and body of the email trigger for dynamic capabilities.

The email trigger parameters have the following structure,

    - parameters:
        - src:
            dependencyName: test-dep
            dataKey: body.to
          dest: email.to.0
        - src:
            dependencyName: test-dep
            dataKey: body.to
          dest: email.to.-1
        - src:
            dependencyName: test-dep
            dataKey: body.from
          dest: email.from
        - src:
            dependencyName: test-dep
            dataKey: body.subject
          dest: email.subject
        - src:
            dependencyName: test-dep
            dataKey: body.emailBody
          dest: email.body


- ```email.to.index``` can be used to overwite an email address already specified in the trigger at the provided index. (where index is an integer)
- ```email.to.-1``` can be used to append a new email address to the addresses to which an email will be sent.
- ```email.from``` can be used to specify the from address of the email sent.
- ```email.body``` can be used to specify the body of the email which will be sent.
- ```email.subject``` can be used to specify the subject of the email which will be sent.
