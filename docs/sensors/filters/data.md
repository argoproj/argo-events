# Data Filter

Data filters are applied to the event data. A CloudEvent from Webhook event-source has payload structure as:

```json
{
    "context": {
      "type": "type_of_event_source",
      "specversion": "cloud_events_version",
      "source": "name_of_the_event_source",
      "id": "unique_event_id",
      "time": "event_time",
      "datacontenttype": "type_of_data",
      "subject": "name_of_the_configuration_within_event_source"
    },
    "data": {
      "header": {},
      "body": {},
    }
}
```

Data filters are applied on `data` within the payload.

## Fields

A data filter has following fields:

```yaml
filters:
  dataLogicalOperator: logical_operator_applied
  data:
    - path: path_within_event_data
      type: types_of_the_data
      comparator: numeric_comparator
      value:
        - list_of_possible_values
```

> ⚠️ `PLEASE NOTE` order in which data filters are declared corresponds to the order in which the Sensor will evaluate them.

## Logical operator

Data filters can be evaluated together in 2 ways:

- `and`, meaning that all data filters returning `true` are required for an event to be valid
- `or`, meaning that only one data filter returning `true` is enough for an event to be valid

Any kind of error is considered as `false` (e.g. path not existing in event body).

Such behaviour can be configured with `dataLogicalOperator` field in a Sensor dependency filters, e.g.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Sensor
metadata:
  name: data-filters-example
spec:
  dependencies:
    - name: sample-dependency
      eventSourceName: webhook
      eventName: sample-event
      filters:
        dataLogicalOperator: "or"
        data:
          - path: "a"
            type: "bool"
            value:
              - "true"
          - path: "b.c"
            type: "number"
            value:
              - "3.14"
          - path: "b.d"
            type: "string"
            value:
              - "hello there"
          # ...
```

Available values:

- `""` (empty), defaulting to `and`
- `and`, default behaviour
- `or`

> ⚠️ `PLEASE NOTE` Data logical operator values must be `lower case`.

## How it works

### Comparator

The data filter offers following `comparators`:

- `>=`
- `>`
- `=`
- `!=`
- `<`
- `<=`

e.g.

```yaml
filters:
  data:
    - path: body.value
      type: number
      comparator: ">"
      value:
        - "50.0"
```

**Note**:

- If data type is `string`, you can pass either an exact value or a regex. In any case that value will be evaluated as a regex.
- If data types is `bool` or `float`, you have to pass an exact value.

### Multiple paths

If the HTTP request was less simple and contained multiple paths that you would like to filter against, you can use [multipaths](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md#multipaths) to combine multiple data paths in the payload into one string.

For a given payload such as:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "action":"opened",
   "labels": [
      {"id":"1234", "name":"Webhook"},
      {"id":"5678", "name":"Approved"}
    ]
  }
}
```

We want our sensor to fire if the action is "opened" and it has a label of "Webhook" or if the action is "closed" and it has a label of "Webhook" and "Approved".

The path would look like `body.action,body.labels.#(name=="Webhook").name,body.labels.#(name=="Approved").name`

This would return a string like: `"opened","Webhook"` or `"closed","Webhook","Approved"`.\

As the resulting data type will be a `string`, we can pass a regex over it:

```yaml
filters:
  data:
    - path: 'body.action,body.labels.#(name=="Webhook").name,body.labels.#(name=="Approved").name'
      type: string
      value:
        - '"opened","Webhook"'
        - '"closed","Webhook","Approved"'
```

### Template

`template` process the incoming data defined in `path` through [sprig template](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig) before matching with the `value`.

e.g.

```yaml
filters:
  data:
    - path: body.message
      type: string
      value:
        - "hello world"
      template: "{{ b64dec .Input }}"
```

The message `'{"message":"aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ="}'` will match with the above filter definition.

**Note**: Data type is assumed to be string before applying the `template`, then cast to the user defined `type` for value matching.

## Practical examples (comparator)

1. Create a webhook event-source

        kubectl -n argo-events apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/examples/event-sources/webhook.yaml

1. Create a webhook sensor with data filter

        kubectl -n argo-events apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/examples/sensors/filter-with-data-simple-1.yaml

1. Send an HTTP request to event-source

        curl -d '{"message":"this is my first webhook"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:12000/example

1. You will notice in sensor logs that the event is invalid as it expects for either `hello` or `hey` as the value of `body.message`

1. Send another HTTP request to event-source

        curl -d '{"message":"hello"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:12000/example

1. Look for a workflow with name starting with `data-workflow-`
