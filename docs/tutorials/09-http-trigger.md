# HTTP Trigger

In previous sections, you saw how to trigger Argo workflows and standard K8s resources. In this
tutorial, you will explore the HTTP triggers. 

Sometimes, you may face a situation where creating an Argo workflow on every event 
is not an ideal solution. This is where the HTTP trigger can help you. With this type of trigger, you can
connect any old/new API server with 20+ event sources supported by Argo Events or invoke serveless fucntions
and not worry about their respective event connector frameworks.
