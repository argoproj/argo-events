# Trigger Conditions

In the previous sections, you have been dealing with just a single dependency.
But, in many cases, you want to wait for multiple events to occur and then
trigger a resource which means you need a mechanism to determine which triggers
to execute based on set of different event dependencies. This mechanism is
supported through `conditions`.

**Note**: Whenever you define multiple dependencies in a sensor, the sensor
applies a `AND` operation, meaning, it will wait for all dependencies to resolve
before it executes triggers. `conditions` can modify that behavior.

## Prerequisite

Minio server must be set up in the `argo-events` namespace with a bucket called
`test` and it should be available at `minio-service.argo-events:9000`.

## Conditions

Consider a scenario where you have a `Webhook` and `Minio` event-source, and you
want to trigger an Argo workflow if the sensor receives an event from the
`Webhook` event-source, but, another workflow if it receives an event from the
`Minio` event-source.

1.  Create the webhook event-source and event-source. The event-source listens
    to HTTP requests on port `12000`

        kubectl -n argo-events apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/examples/tutorials/06-trigger-conditions/webhook-event-source.yaml

2.  Create the minio event-source. The event-source listens to events of type
    `PUT` and `DELETE` for objects in bucket `test`.

        kubectl -n argo-events apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/examples/tutorials/06-trigger-conditions/minio-event-source.yaml

Make sure there are no errors in any of the event-sources.

3.  Let's create the sensor. If you take a closer look at the trigger templates,
    you will notice that it contains a field named `conditions`, which is a
    boolean expression contains dependency names. So, as soon as the expression
    is resolved as true, the corresponding trigger will be executed.

         kubectl -n argo-events apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/examples/tutorials/06-trigger-conditions/sensor-01.yaml

4.  Send a HTTP request to Webhook event-source,

        curl -d '{"message":"this is my first webhook"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:12000/example

5.  You will notice an Argo worklfow with name `group-1-xxxx` is created with
    following output,

         __________________________
        < this is my first webhook >
         --------------------------
            \
             \
              \
                            ##        .
                      ## ## ##       ==
                   ## ## ## ##      ===
               /""""""""""""""""___/ ===
          ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
               \______ o          __/
                \    \        __/
                  \____\______/

6.  Now, lets generate a Minio event so that we can run `group-2-xxxx` workflow.
    Drop a file onto `test` bucket. The workflow that will get created will
    print the name of the bucket as follows,


         ______
        < test >
         ------
            \
             \
              \
                            ##        .
                      ## ## ##       ==
                   ## ## ## ##      ===
               /""""""""""""""""___/ ===
          ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
               \______ o          __/
                \    \        __/
                  \____\______/

5.  Great!! You have now learned how to use `conditions`. Lets update the sensor
    with a trigger that waits for both dependencies to resolve. This is the
    normal sensor behavior if `conditions` is not defined.

         kubectl -n argo-events apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/examples/tutorials/06-trigger-conditions/sensor-02.yaml

    Send a HTTP request and perform a file drop on Minio bucket as done above.
    You should following output,


         _______________________________
        < this is my first webhook test >
         -------------------------------
            \
             \
              \
                            ##        .
                      ## ## ##       ==
                   ## ## ## ##      ===
               /""""""""""""""""___/ ===
          ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
               \______ o          __/
                \    \        __/
                  \____\______/
