# Getting Started

We are going to set up a sensor and event-source for webhook. The goal is to trigger an Argo workflow upon a HTTP Post request.

Note: You will need to have [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/docs/argo/readme.html) installed to make this work.

1. Make sure to have the eventbus pods running in the namespace. Run following command to create the eventbus,

        kubectl apply -n argo-events -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/examples/eventbus/native.yaml

1. Setup event-source for webhook as follows,

        kubectl apply -n argo-events -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/examples/event-sources/webhook.yaml

   The above event-source contains a single event configuration that runs an HTTP server on port `12000` with endpoint `example`.

   After running the above command, the event-source controller will create a pod and service.

1. Create webhook sensor,

        kubectl apply -n argo-events -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/examples/sensors/webhook.yaml

   Once the sensor object is created, sensor controller will create corresponding pod and a service. 

1. Expose the event-source pod via Ingress, OpenShift Route or port forward to consume requests over HTTP.

        kubectl -n argo-events port-forward <event-source-pod-name> 12000:12000

1. Use either Curl or Postman to send a post request to the http://localhost:12000/example

        curl -d '{"message":"this is my first webhook"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:12000/example

1. Verify that an Argo workflow was triggered.

        kubectl -n argo-events get workflows | grep "webhook"
