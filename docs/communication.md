## How gateway forwards events to sensor?
There are two ways an event is dispatched from gateway to sensor:

  1. **HTTP**
  2. **NATS standard or streaming service**

## HTTP
* To use HTTP as communication channel between gateway and sensor, you need to configure the `eventProtocol` in gateway as HTTP. Then, you need to specify
the port on which the HTTP server in sensor will be running. The HTTP server is spun up automatically with the port configured in sensor spec when
you create the sensor with `eventProtocol` as HTTP.

* You don't need to specify address of sensor pod. The sensor pod is exposed through a ClusterIP service. This is taken care by sensor controller.
The name of the sensor service is formatted in a specific way by sensor controller so that gateway can create the service name from sensor name.
This is how gateway gets the service name of sensor by sensor name and using the port defined in spec, gateway makes HTTP POST requests to sensor service.

## NATS Standard & Streaming
* To use NATS standard or streaming as communication channel between gateway and sensor, you need to configure the `eventProtocol` in gateway as NATS and type as either `Standard` or `Streaming`
You can read more about NATS [here](https://nats.io/documentation/)

* In case of NATS, gateway doesn't need to be aware of sensors, as the gateway acts as a publisher and sensor/s acts as subscriber. With NATS as communication channel, you can store events in external persistent volume.
This gives you ability to replay events in future for any reasons. Read more about storing NATS messages [here](https://nats.io/blog/use-cases-for-persistent-logs-with-nats-streaming/)

*  NATS also helps components that are not part of Argo-Events to consume events generated by gateway.

* For a sensor to consume the events from NATS, the `eventProtocol` needs to specified as NATS. You can then configure the Standard or Streaming connection in details further in `eventProtocol`.

  1. Standard NATS example
     [**Gateway Example**](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/examples/gateways/webhook-nats-standard.yaml)
     [**Sensor Example**](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/examples/sensors/webhook-nats.yaml)
   
  2. Streaming NATS example
     [**Gateway Example**](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/examples/gateways/webhook-nats-streaming.yaml)
     [**Sensor Example**](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/examples/sensors/webhook-nats-streaming.yaml)
 
 **Note**: The framework **_does not_** provide a NATS installation. You can follow [this guide](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-operator) to install NATS onto your cluster.
