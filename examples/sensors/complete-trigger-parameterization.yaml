# The event payload for this example =
#
#  {
#   "name": "trigger-wf-1",
#   "namespace": "argo-events",
#   "bucket": "mybucket",
#   "key": "hello.yaml",
#   "image": "docker/busybox",
#  }
#
# The example refers to workflow stored on a S3 bucket. With normal sensor spec, you would hard-code the S3 bucket name, object key and other things in trigger.
# But user would like to have dynamic trigger spec where depending on the data in the payload.
# The example data payload contains information like bucket, key, name, namespace which is used to replace the placeholders in trigger spec.
# The image in payload will be used to replace the image in the workflow.
