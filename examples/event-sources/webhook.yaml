  # gateway can run multiple HTTP servers. Simply define a unique port to start a new HTTP server

  example: |-
    # port to run HTTP server on
    port: "12000"
    # endpoint to listen to
    endpoint: "/index"
    # HTTP request method to allow. In this case, only POST requests are accepted
    method: "POST"

  example-secure: |-
    port: "13000"
    endpoint: "/secure"
    method: "POST"
    # path to file that is mounted in gateway pod which contains certs
    serverCertPath: "/bin/webhook-secure/crt"
    # path to file that is mounted in gateway pod which contains private key
    serverKeyPath: "/bin/webhook-secure/key"

  # example 3 and 4 shows how you can add multiple endpoints on same HTTP server

  example-3: |-
    port: "14000"
    endpoint: "/example3"

  example-4: |-
