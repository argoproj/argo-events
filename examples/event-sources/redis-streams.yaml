      hostAddress: redis.argo-events.svc:6379

      # Password required for authentication.

      db: 0
      
      # MaxMsgCountPerRead holds the maximum number of messages per stream that will be read in each XREADGROUP of all streams
      # Example: if there are 2 streams and MaxMsgCountPerRead=10, then each XREADGROUP may read upto a total of 20 messages.
      # Same as COUNT option in XREADGROUP(https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro). Defaults to 10
      # +optional
      # maxMsgCountPerRead: 50

      # Messages are read through this group. Defaults to 'argo-events-cg'
      # +optional
      # consumerGroup: argo-events-cg
      
      # Streams to listen for events. XREADGROUP is used on all streams using a single consumer group.
