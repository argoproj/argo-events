# Contributor Code of Conduct
We welcome participation from individuals and groups of all backgrounds who want to benefit the broader open source community through participation in this project. We are dedicated to ensuring a productive, safe and educational experience for all.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Guidelines
Be welcoming
* Make it easy for new members to learn and contribute. Help them along the path. Don't make them jump through hoops.

Be considerate
* There is a live person at the other end of the Internet. Consider how your comments will affect them. It is often better to give a quick but useful reply than to delay to compose a more thorough reply.

Be respectful
* Not everyone is Linus Torvalds, and this is probably a good thing :) but everyone is deserving of respect and consideration for wanting to benefit the broader community. Criticize ideas but respect the person. Saying something positive before you criticize lets the other person know that your criticism is not personal.

Be patient
* We have diverse backgrounds. It will take time and effort to understand each others' points of view. Some of us have day jobs and other responsibilities and may take time to respond to requests.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team lead at vaibhav.page@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
