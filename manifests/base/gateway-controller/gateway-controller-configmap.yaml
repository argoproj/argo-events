      # instanceID is a label selector to limit the controller's watch to a specific instance. It
      # contains an arbitrary value that is carried forward into its pod labels, under the key
      # gateways.argoproj.io/gateway-controller-instanceid, for the purposes of date segregation.
      # This enables a controller to only watch the gateway that it is interested about,
      # in order to support multiple controllers in a single cluster, and ultimately allows the
      # controller itself to be bundled as part of a higher level application. If omitted, the
      # controller watches gateways that *are not* labeled with an instance id.
      instanceID: <instanceID>

      # namespace is used for namespaced installation, if it is specified, the controller only 
      # watches gateways in this namespace.
      namespace: <your_namespace>
